# Exorcist
This bot changes 'evil' links to better front-ends.

There currently exist two versions of this bot. A Matrix version and a Discord version.

The matrix bot can be invited to any room and it will work. For the bot to remove the evil messages, you have to grant it the right to remove messages...
The bot is: [@exorcist:mstdn.social](https://matrix.to/#/@exorcist:mstdn.social)

It changes:

* Twitter -> Nitter
* Instagram -> Bibliogram
* Medium -> Scribe
* YouTube -> Invidious
* Reddit -> Teddit
* GoogleTranslate -> SimplyTranslate
* GoogleSearch -> Searx, Ecosia, Duckduckgo or StartPage
* GoogleMaps -> OpenStreetMap
It also unshortens shortened URL's.

The bot will ignore your message if you use `%NoDevil` anywhere in your message.
You can report bugs by mentioning the bot and using `%BugReport` in your message.
